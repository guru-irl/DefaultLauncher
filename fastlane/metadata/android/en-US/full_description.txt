Default Launcher is a clean, customizable home screen built on AOSP Launcher3 from Android 16. No bloat, no tracking, no internet connections. Just a fast, beautiful launcher that respects your privacy.


PRIVACY FIRST

Fully offline. No internet permissions, no telemetry, no analytics, no ads. Your home screen data never leaves your device. The source code is open for anyone to verify.


SMART CONFIGURABLE GRID

Pick your columns (4 to 10) and rows are calculated automatically so every cell is a perfect square. Icons rearrange themselves when you change the grid, so nothing gets deleted. The dock is part of the grid with consistent spacing, not a separate floating bar.


ICON CUSTOMIZATION

Thousands of icon packs supported in ADW format. Choose a global icon shape: circle, square, cookie, arch, or raw. Customize individual app icons from the long-press menu with different icons for the home screen and app drawer.


ADVANCED FOLDERS

- Cover icons: replace the mini-icon preview with a monochrome emoji from a searchable picker
- Expanded folders: display folder contents directly on the home screen as a 2x2 or 3x3 grid
- Resize: drag corner handles to grow or shrink folders on the workspace
- Per-folder shapes: override the global icon shape on individual folders
- Customizable colors: separate background colors for folder icons, open panels, and covers


APP DRAWER

Adjustable label size with two-line labels for long app names. Configurable row spacing. Background color and opacity controls. Custom scrollbar color.


UNIVERSAL SEARCH

Search apps, shortcuts, contacts, calendar events, and files from one place. Built-in calculator and unit converter. Choose your preferred web search app. Filter results with category chips.


MATERIAL 3 DESIGN

Dynamic colors that adapt to your wallpaper. Full dark mode support. Customizable colors for the drawer background, search bar, tabs, and folders.


GESTURES

Swipe down for notifications. Swipe up for the app drawer.


BUILT ON AOSP

Based directly on Android 16's Launcher3 source code. No proprietary Google dependencies. Reliable and lightweight.
